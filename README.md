## Overview
This tool is designed to help users understand deep learning concepts through interactive visualizations, examples, and real-world model applications. Built with **Streamlit** for the front-end, the app offers a smooth experience and will soon integrate various deep learning models for hands-on learning.

---

## Features
- **Interactive UI/UX** powered by Streamlit
- Hands-on experience with deep learning models (Coming Soon)
- Simple and clean interface for easy navigation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:

2. Install Streamlit:
```pip install streamlit```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the client folder:
```cd client```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
```streamlit run app.py```

3. Open the local server link (usually http://localhost:8501) to view the app.

## Future Improvements
- Add pre-trained deep learning models for predictions
- Implement interactive learning modules and quizzes
- Provide real-time visualizations of model outputs
